      "longDescription": "<p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> This perspective can be used to search Finnish coin finds using the faceted filters on the left-hand side of the page. The database contains more than 18.000 coin finds reported to the National Heritage between 2013 and 2013. The search results can be browsed and visualised using the following tabs: </p> <ul class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\"> <li> <strong>TABLE</STRONG> tab presents the coin finds as a list with attributes. By selecting a link for a concept, you can also access its entity pages. </li> <li> <strong>MAP</STRONG> tab presents the locations where the coins were found. Several base maps are available, including historical maps. Archaeological sites from the Ancient Relics Register can be added as a layer (zoom level 13), and a 200 m protection zone within which archaeology should not be searched can be calculated. You can break down clusters, eventually showing individual sites, by zooming in on the map or by clicking on a cluster. Please note that the accuracy of the find location varies; the coordinate points are as given in the original report and may indicate the exact location of the find or, for example, the centre of the field where the find was made. About 8% of the finds lack coordinates and are not displayed on the map. </li> <li> <strong>HEAT MAP</strong> tab generates a kernel density estimation surface that illustrates broader patterns in the distribution of finds. Zooming in or out changes the kernel width used, creating a more detailed or a more general view of the distribution. </li> <li> <strong>PIE/BAR CHART</strong> presents the contents of the statistically as a pie or a bar chart. The following, and more, attribute categories can be selected: period, authority, mint and context.</li> <li> <strong>AORISTIC CHART</strong>  tab illustrates temporal distribution in the data. As many of the coins can only be dated by approximate broad period a conventional statistical timeline visualization cannot be used. The aorist chart is based on a probabilistic calculation of the average weight of coin finds falling into the boxes (columns) in which the timeline is divided (you can choose between four box sizes).  </li> <li> <strong>MINTS</strong> tab visualizes the numbers of selected coins according to their mint locations with a kernel density estimation map surface.</li> <li> <strong>MIGRATIONS</strong> tab presents the movement of the coins from their minting locations (blue end) to their discovery sites (red end). If the place where the coin was struck is not known, no arc is drawn. For visual clarity, the arc terminated at the centre of find municipality rather than at the exact location of the find. Zooming in closer and selecting an arc will open a window listing the coins that make up that arc; selecting an individual coin will take you to its entity page. You can tilt the map view on a Windows machine by clicking the right mouse button and moving the arrow, or on a Mac by pressing mouse/control pad + control and moving the arrow. </li> <li> <strong>FIND YEAR ANIMATIO</strong> tab shows where in Finland coin finds were reported each year from 2013 to 2023. </li> <li> <strong>MINTING YEAR ANIMATION</strong> tab shows the arrival of coins in Finland from the Late Iron Age onwards, according to their earliest estimated year of minting (terminus post quem). </li> <li> <strong>CSV</strong>  tab allows you to download the coin finds you have selected using the faceted search, or all coin finds, as a CSV file.</li></ul>",

  "instructions": "<h1 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h2 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Instructions </h1> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> The search functionality of this semantic portal is based on the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2200/S00190ED1V01Y200904ICR005\" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'> faceted search</a> paradigm. By default each perspective displays all results from the corresponding class. This default result set can be narrowed down by using the filters on the left. </p> <h2 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Using a single filter </h2> <h3 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Selecting values within a filter </h3> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> All possible values for a filter are displayed either as a list or as a hierarchical tree structure (if available). The number of results is shown in brackets for each value. Once a value is selected, the results are automatically updated. To prevent further selections that do not return any results, also the possible values for all other filters are updated at the same time. </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> Multiple values can be selected within a single filter. Selecting multiple values generates results that contain any of the selected values. For example, selecting both <i>Saint Augustine</i> and <i>Saint Jerome</i> as an Author returns results that include either <i>Saint Augustine</i> <strong>OR</strong> <i>Saint Jerome</i> as an Author. </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> Selected values of a filter appear in the Active filters section at the top of the list of filters. To deselect a filter, click the X mark next to it within the Active filters section. You can also deselect a filter value by unchecking the checkmark in the filter’s value list. The Active filters section only appears if there are filter values currently selected. </p> <h3 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h6 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Searching within a filter </h3> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> Search within a filter by using the search field at the top of each filter. All possible values of a filter remain visible at all times. The values of the filter that match the search term are indicated by a purple underline. </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> Steps for searching within filters: </p> <ol class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> <li> Type search term into search field. If there are matches, a number will appear to the right of the search field, indicating the number of filter values that match the search term. </li> <li> Click the arrows to the right of the search field to cycle through the results. As you click the arrow, a different filter value will appear at the top of the list. Matched filters are underlined in purple. </li> <li> Click the checkmark next to a filter value to activate it. The results (and also other filters) are automatically updated. </li> </ol> <h2 class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h4 MuiTypography-gutterBottom\"> Using multiple filters simultaneously </h2> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\"> The effectiveness of faceted search is realized when multiple filters are applied at the same time. As in many e-commerce sites, a logical AND is always used between the filters. For example selecting <i>Saint Augustine </i> and <i>Saint Jerome</i> as an Author and <i>Sir Thomas Phillipps</i> and <i> Thomas Thorpe</i> as an Owner, the results are narrowed down as follows: </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\"> (Author: <i>Saint Augustine</i> <strong>OR</strong> Author: <i>Saint Jerome</i>) </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\"> <strong>AND</strong> </p> <p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\"> (Owner: <i>Sir Thomas Phillipps</i> <strong>OR</strong> Owner: <i>Thomas Thorpe</i>) </p>",
